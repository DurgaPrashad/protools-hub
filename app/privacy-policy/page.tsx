          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            At ProToolsHub, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy
            policy will inform you about how we look after your personal data when you visit our website and tell you
            about your privacy rights and how the law protects you.
          </p>

          <h2>The Data We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            Most of our tools process data directly in your browser. This means that the information you input (such as
            text for the word counter or URLs for the QR code generator) is processed locally on your device and is not
            sent to or stored on our servers.
          </p>
          <p>However, we do collect some anonymous usage data to help us improve our service:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Technical data including browser type, device type, and operating system</li>
            <li>Usage data such as which tools are used most frequently</li>
            <li>Analytics data to understand how users interact with our website</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
          <p>We use the collected data for various purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To improve our website and tools</li>
            <li>To understand how users interact with our services</li>
            <li>To detect, prevent, and address technical issues</li>
            <li>To monitor the usage of our website</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
          <p>
            We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our website and hold certain
            information. Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an anonymous unique identifier.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if
            you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our website.
          </p>

          <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our website</li>
            <li>To provide the website on our behalf</li>
            <li>To perform website-related services</li>
            <li>To assist us in analyzing how our website is used</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are
            obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.
          </p>

          <h2>Google Analytics</h2>
          <p>
            We use Google Analytics to monitor and analyze the use of our website. Google Analytics is a web analytics
            service that tracks and reports website traffic. This data is shared with other Google services. Google may
            use the collected data to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can opt-out of having your activity on the website made available to Google Analytics by installing the
            Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on. The add-on prevents Google Analytics JavaScript from sharing
            information with Google Analytics about visits activity.
          </p>

          <h2>Google AdSense</h2>
          <p>
            We use Google AdSense to show advertisements on our website. Google AdSense uses cookies to serve ads based
            on a user's prior visits to our website or other websites. Google's use of advertising cookies enables it
            and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the
            Internet.
          </p>
          <p>You may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting Google's Ads Settings.</p>

            Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.

            You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy
            are effective when they are posted on this page.
